# TaikoModStuff
A QoL mod for Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master!

TaikoModStuff allows a number of Quality-of-Life enhancements to TDM by allowing:

* Forcing the usage of the JP font everywhere
* Removing the 60 FPS cap the game forces
* Allowing to toggle VSync
* Allowing to set a custom resolution for TDM (Note: _This can cause conflicts with Fluto's [TaikoMods](https://github.com/Fluto/TaikoMods)' fullscreen disabler, so please disable that function if using with TaikoModStuff_)

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Repflez/TaikoModStuff/releases/latest) of TaikoModStuff.
2. Please download the latest version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) x64. The filename should look like `BepInEx_x64_XXXXX.zip`.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file on the root of your TDM's install. The result should look [like the image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/659133/151962598-f5d3d4f0-1d1e-42dc-a757-6398bcdfa973.png).
4. Create the `plugins` folder insude your BepInEx folder. The result should look [like the image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/659133/151963164-56a2f1d1-3e27-4a91-81f4-9d3ffddb49a7.png). Note that the image shows more folders and files than you may have. This is normal.
5. Extract the TaikoModStuff zip inside the `plugins` folder. It's not required to extract TaikoModStuff.pdb, but it can help when reporting bugs.
6. Start TDM, then close it when you reach the Title Screen.
7. Inside the BepInEx folder, you'll see a `config` folder. Edit the `TaikoModStuff.cfg` file inside it to configure TaikoModStuff.
